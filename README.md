Ideas and Resources

  Hello everybody! 
    "Hi Doctor Nick" (if you get this reference we can definitely be friends)
      I am a graphic designer, video and photo editor and have always had the desire to learn more about the world of programming. I definitely want to express how reluctant I am to have found the Odin project and GitHub and I am very excited to get started! 
      I aspire to reach the goals I have in mind for myself plus make valuable connections with other programmers along the way.
